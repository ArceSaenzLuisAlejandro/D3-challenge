          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Poverty. It can be observed in the visualization that there's a positive correlation to the % of lack of healthcare, which means that if poverty increases there's a high change that lak of health will increase. For smokers apply the same principle as lack of healthcare; as poverty increases the amount of smokers will do the same. In the case of Obessity index, is seems like there's a positive almost flat correlation, which means that obsessity will be there no matter if the family is poor or not. </p>

          <p>Age. Lack of healthcare is negatively correlated to the age, which means that the older someone gets less the probability of lacking of healthcare will be; this makes sense because of all the healthcare programs created for older people. In the case of smoker percentage, it looks like a cluster of points betwen 35 and 41 years old, which means that there's a chance to find almost the same amount of smokers between these ages. Meanwhile, obessity, as well as lack of healtcare, seems to be reduced as someone gets older; this might be true because of two main reasons: Older people die of obessity and that's why the index is too low or maybe as they get older they recive better attention to reduce their weight. We need more data to go further these assumptions.</p>

          <p>Income. As income decreases, the more lack of healthcare will be, which makes sense. Also, there's an even stronger correlation between the income and smokers; the more the income is, the less the probability of being a smoker will be. So, if you perceive a lower income, you will have more chances to be a smoker. Finally, the obessity visualization shows the same behavior as before; the lower the income is, more chances of being obesse will be. This might be true because of the cost of healthy food, which limit lower income families to buy fast cheaper unhealthy food. </p>
